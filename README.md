# Phidgets

Code to run the Phidgets project in a Jupyter Notebook on the Callysto Hub (or other Jupyter environments). It does not work in Jupyter Lab, it must operate in the Classic Jupyter Hub.

Must run in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Opera in order to access [WebUSB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebUSB).

Requires a [Phidget starter kit](https://www.phidgets.com/education/free/), with a humidity/temperature sensor attached.
